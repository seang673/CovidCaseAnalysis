# CovidCaseAnalysis
This project consisted of me retrieving and extracting two dataframes that contained information about covid cases in the cities of New York and Chicago. I implemented a cleaning strategy for the data, and analyzed whether there  is a statistically significant difference in the average cases and deaths per day of covid-19 patients during the summer of 2020 between New York City and Chicago
